Linux networks are becoming more and more common, but security is often an overlooked  
issue. Unfortunately, in today’s environment all networks are potential hacker targets,  
from top-secret military research networks to small home LANs.  
Linux Network Securty focuses on securing Linux in a networked environment, where the  
security of the entire network needs to be considered rather than just isolated machines.  
It uses a mix of theory and practicl techniques to teach administrators how to install and  
use security applications, as well as how the applcations work and why they are necessary.
