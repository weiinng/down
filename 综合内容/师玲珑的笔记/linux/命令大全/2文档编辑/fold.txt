Linux fold命令用于限制文件列宽。

fold指令会从指定的文件里读取内容，将超过限定列宽的列加入增列字符后，输出到标准输出设备。若不指定任何文件名称，或是所给予的文件名为"-"，则fold指令会从标准输入设备读取数据。

语法
fold [-bs][-w<每列行数>][--help][--version][文件...]
参数：

-b或--bytes 以Byte为单位计算列宽，而非采用行数编号为单位。
-s或--spaces 以空格字符作为换列点。
-w<每列行数>或--width<每列行数> 设置每列的最大行数。
--help 在线帮助。
--version 显示版本信息。
实例
将一个名为testfile 的文件的行折叠成宽度为30，可使用如下命令：

fold -w 30 testfile
为了对比，先将testfile文件输出如下：

$ cat testfile #查看testfile 中的内容  
Linux networks are becoming more and more common, but 
security is often an overlooked  
issue. Unfortunately, in today’s environment all networks 
are potential hacker targets,  
from top-secret military research networks to small home LANs.  
Linux Network Security focuses on securing Linux in a 
networked environment, where the  
security of the entire network needs to be considered 
rather than just isolated machines.  
It uses a mix of theory and practical techniques to 
teach administrators how to install and  
use security applications, as well as how the 
applications work and why they are necessary. 
然后使用fold命令折叠显示：

$ fold -w 30 testfile #行折叠成宽度为30，显示testfile 文件
